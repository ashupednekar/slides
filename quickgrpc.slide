## Welcome to Quick gRPC

Ready to ditch WSGI and join the microservices party? Letâ€™s gRPC and roll!

## But REST api's are great... Why bother?

## Are they though? ðŸ«¤

.html three.html

## And then there's WSGI
<br><br>

WSGI/ASGI: Where Python speed goes to die.

Gunicorn: Because who doesnâ€™t love configuring worker counts for every full moon?

Async in ASGI? Sure, if you enjoy threading needles with spaghetti.

Scaling? Just keep throwing Gunicorn workers at it and pray.

Deployment is a breeze... said no one ever.

## So what exactly is gRPC

<br>
gRPC is like a supercharged intercom system for your microservices. ðŸš€
<br><br>

- **Protocol:** Think of HTTP/2 as the speedy highway for your data, zipping it around efficiently.
- **Serialization:** Protocol Buffers (protobuf) are like a universal translator, helping different services speak the same language.
- **Language Support:** Supports multiple languages, so you can have a polyglot party and everyone gets along!
- **Streaming:** Handles requests and responses like a pro, even when theyâ€™re long-winded or chatty.
